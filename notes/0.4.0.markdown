This is the first release of local-imports, a `scalac` plugin providing compact syntax for locally importing the contents of values.

Example use:

``` scala
object T {

  type X = String
  val x: X = "hola!"
}

// this will be "hola!"
val z = inside(T1) { x } 

// it will get rewritten to
val z = {
  val inside_local_0 = T1
  import inside_local_0._
  x
}
```

The plugin code is based on [mpilquist/local-implicits](https://github.com/mpilquist/local-implicits); what it actually does is of course completely different, even if both plugins can be used for similar purposes.
